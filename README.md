This is a food review site for users to share yummy food and give their thoughts.

## Live Version

## User stories
As a User, I want to
* have my own profile so I can store my personal stuff.
* write reviews so I can share my experience of the food I tried with other users.
* update my review so I can edit it and maybe give a better opinion in the future.
* bookmark other user's review so I can have a list for where to eat next.
* see a gallery of food photos so I can glance through and choose the food for review faster.
* have a link for the location so I can go straight to google map for the direction.
* leave comments on other's review so I can voice my support or against to the review.
* view other user's profile so I can view their reviews and bookmarks.
