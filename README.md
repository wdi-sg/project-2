CUE requires user registration for use. After signing up and logging in, users can start by creating new playlists, looking at a list of all playlists, or searching for playlists by name.

Users can create playlists collaboratively by adding tracks or voting on tracks to place them higher or lower in the playlists. Users can only delete tracks in a playlist if they are the creator of the playlist or the contributor of the track. Users can only delete playlists that they have created.

Users can also like playlists so that they can be easily accessed in their profile page, along with playlists that they have created.
