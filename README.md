Salty Lemon is an app for programmers who feel like when the going gets tough and you feel like giving up, and you feel like you are not good enough that at that moment of despair, you may find comfort and hope.

This app shows you three quotes at the homepage at specific time-interval that is tailored to speak to you at that time of the day. For example on Friday evening, you want a quote that is light, so the quote shown could be something like "Drop your work, go grab a beer and work can start later".
